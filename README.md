## CSc 690 - Final Project Idea
   For the final project I decided I wanted to Re-create the twitter app. The way
   this would work is by getting the API from the website "twitter" at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started
   This website will get the current users tweets from the people the user follows. Since the website has to refresh constantly my app will automatically will refresh as well and give you the most recent tweets.
   Usere will be able to retweet, like and unlike tweets as well as even post.
